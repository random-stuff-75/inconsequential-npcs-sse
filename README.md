Inconsequential NPCs Skyrim Special Edition

A port of this mod:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36334
to Skyrim Special Edition.

The esp was ported using Bathesda Creation Kit, I just loaded it, made a trivial change, undid the change and saved it.
The bsa was repacked for SSE using Cathedral Assets Optimiser https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316 .
Feel free to repeat these steps yourself if you dont want to use my version but to be clear the file on here is ALREADY PORTED FOR YOU.

# Download
Click on the .7z file and then select "download raw file" from the download icon (the downwards arrow in the cluster of icons on the right side of the page).

# Usage - mod manager 
The exiting file format should be compatible with most mod managers so import it directly (Ive only tested it on vortex though ..). If you are using any patches you will have to setup ordering rules or manually sort the esps so that this esp is loaded before the patches.

# Usage - manual
Use an archive program like 7zip to extract the files into your Skyrim /Data directory.

# FAQ:
Q: "Why isnt this on Nexus ?"
A: Read the mod description page and the comments.
